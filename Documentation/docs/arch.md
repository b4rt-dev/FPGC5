# Architecture
The FPGC5 consists of four main parts: the CPU, GPU, MU and APU, where the APU is the only component for which I used already existing hardware.

The CPU, called the B322, is the main part that executes all instructions. It reads and writes to the MU. The CPU consists of an timer that handles the timing of the CPU phases, an instruction decoder that splits the 32 bits of each instructions, an PC unit that handles all program counter related functions like jumps and interrupts, an ALU that can do 16 different operations on two 32 bit inputs, a register bank that contains 16 32 bit registers, a stack and finally a control unit that directs certain signals based on the instruction.
 
The GPU, called the FSX2, is completely separate from the CPU. It contains the logic for generating a video signal and for creating an image on this signal based on the contents of VRAM. The GPU has its own read port with clock on the VRAM, since all of it is true dual port SRAM, allowing it to run on a completely different clock domain than the rest of the FPGC5.

The MU, or memory unit, handles all memory access between the CPU and all the different memories used in the FPGC5. These memories includes: SDRAM, SPI flash, internal ROM, 8 bit VRAM, 9 bit VRAM, 32 bit VRAM and a lot of I/O like UART and SPI ports, SNES controller register and PS/2 keyboard register. The MU makes use of a memory map to allow the CPU to access these memories. The goal of the MU is to have the CPU access all memories without the CPU having to care about the type or timing of the memory, making an easy memory interface for the CPU. This is achieved using a start signal from the CPU to the MU to indicate the start of a memory read or write, and a busy signal from the MU to the CPU which only goes high when the start signal is received, and goes low when the data is read or written. However, there is one cycle of overhead per operation on the MU.

The APU, or audio processing unit, is a seperate MCU with its own RAM and storage, just like the SNES uses a seperate SPC700 and DSP chip to generate audio. In the case of the FPGC5, a more modern and capable ESP32 is used with an I2S DAC attached to it. It currently works as a synthesizer, where the FPGC5 sends (in the future: custom) MIDI signals over UART to the ESP32, which then generates and outputs the sound in real time (with a few ms of delay because of the I2S buffer). Having it connected over UART allows for easy hardware upgrades, in case I ever want to switch to a STM32 based MCU.
