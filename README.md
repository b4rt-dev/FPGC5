# FPGC5

My big project, basically started in July 2019 as FPGC3 (versions 1 and 2 do not count). Project exists to learn more about the fundamentals of computers and to improve my Verilog skills, while also designing my own "environment" (PCB, Compilers, OS, etc.) around it.

FPGC is a completely self designed computer, implemented in an EP4CE15 FPGA.
